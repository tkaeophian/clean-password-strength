## Scalable vs Quick and Dirty Password Strength

This repository demonstrates two approaches to solving the same problem: quick-and-dirty vs. scalable and maintainable. Explore how design choices impact future development, maintainability, and scalability.

### Features

ðŸ›  Quick-and-Dirty Approach: Fast to implement but challenging to extend or maintain.

ðŸŒŸ Scalable Solution: Modular, future-proof, and designed for long-term growth.

### Why It Matters

Quick solutions might save time now, but scalable solutions save headaches later. This repository highlights the importance of making thoughtful design choices early in your development process.
